# Weather Dashboard
This application was made to allow the user to search for a city and have the related weather forecast displayed on the screen. Both the current date of user activity and the 5-day forcast. The user's searches will be saved in localStorage and will appear underneath the search box for ease of use.

## Goals for the Project ( User Story )
AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
